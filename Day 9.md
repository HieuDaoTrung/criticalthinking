## UNIT 5: MORRPHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. What is it?
  - Morphological Analysis is also a tool (just like 6-thinking-hats, various types of brainstormning) to generate new ideas
  - MA can be used for team as well as personal
  - Unlike other techniques which focus mainly on diversity of ideas from multiple perspeective, MA is based on breaking down a probelem into smaller terms/ sub-functions

2. MA's Principles:
  - Break the problem down into elementary components (aka Subfunctions)
  - SKetch an idea table (Table form or Grid form) for solutions of each subfunction
  - From each subfunction, pick the best solution
  - The combination of those best solutions is the final solution toward the final big problem

3. Important notes:
  - MA can be used on any fields/ disciplines
  - 
  
4. Application in Plot Line design (for movies or acting)
