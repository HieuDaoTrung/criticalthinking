## UNIT 4: SIX THINKING HATS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Diversity is very important for success, that is why a group should consist of people from different backgrounds.

2. Can we characterize the approach of successful people? What do they like? How could they get things done?
  - They are positive.
  - They may fail to look at a problem from an emotional, intuitive, creative or negative viewpoint.
  - Emotional people, pessimists are likely to fail more
  > Effective thinking needs to be deliberate
  
3. Principles of "6 thinking hats"
  - This is to enhance the structure of thinking so that decision making and idea evaluation can be greatly improved
  - The six hats technique provides a framework to help people think clearly and thoroughly by adopting and directing different modes of thinking in one direction at a time. These different modes of thinking are characterized by six different coloured hats. This is to enable more expansive, increased creativity and decision-making.
  - You can use Six Thinking Hats in group meetings or on your own. In a group, it has the benefit of blocking the confrontations that happen when people with different thinking styles discuss the same problem
  - 6 colors of hats:
    - *White*: providing facts, figure, information - which are quantification and proven to see what we can learn from.
    > Analyze past trend and extrapolate from historical data.
    >> White hat thinking requires discipline and direction where the participants strive to be neutral and *OBJECTIVE*, *not SUBJECTIVE* in their contributions.
    - *Red*: emotional approach, love/like/hate? Define the problem using intuition, gut reaction, and emotion.
    > Try to think of how other people will react emotionally. Try to understand the responses of people who do not fully know your reasoning.
    - *Black*: critical thinking. Look at some idea or decision critically, cautiously and defensively.
    > Try to see why an idea does not work, find the weak points, fatal flaws, risks of the plans, eliminate them and make a more resilient one.
    >> Be cautious and careful. We need to consider and assess the dangers of following a particular direction and identify any errors in thinking.
    - *Yellow*: think positively and optimistic.
    > It's symbolic of an optimistic viewpoints that helps you see all the benefits of an idea or decision and the value in it.
    - *Green*: creativity, generate ideas.
    > This is where you develop creative ideas and solutions to a problem. A whole range of creativity tools can help you here.
    - *Blue*: process control to determine the next step in the meeting, the outcome of each step in the meeting or the final outcome of the whole meeting.
    > When running into difficulties because ideas are running dry, the blue hat can direct the activities.
    >> Control all the other hats.
