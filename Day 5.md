# CREATIVE THINKING: TECHNIQUES AND METHODS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## UNIT 1: INTRODUCTION TO PRINCIPLES OF CREATIVE THINKING

### Father and mother of creativity
1. Two levels of creativity:
  - Small "c" - modest garden-variety changes vs Big "C" - leads to breakthrough
  - Eminent vs Everyday

2. Quote "Necessity is the mother of invention" => Then, who is the father? "It's the opportunity"

3. Formula: PROBLEM + IDEA = SOLUTION

4. **What is creativity and why we need it?**

>> "Creativity is the **IMAGINATION** with **RESPONSIBILITY**" - Sae Ra Kung 2009

A repeated insight from the study of creativity is the value of patronage, investing in and supporting an activity. Patronage enables attention. It releases us from from varied tasks such as cleaning, childcare and teaching. Although of course, these tasks are valuable and enjoyable in some cases. So key times we're able to concentrate and develop our skills with a night domain experiment and then apply them. Patronage pays for costly rigs, experiments, research and support teams. It enables innovation and the realization of an idea. So now back to our definition we will use repeatedly in this course for creativity. Creativity is the ability to imagine or invent something new or value where the value may be personal, societal, financial or some combination of these. Creativity is not the ability to create something out of nothing, but the ability to generate new ideas by combining, changing or reapplying existing ideas. Some creative ideas are astonishing and brilliant while others are just simple good practical ideas that no one seems to have thought of yet.
