# CREATIVE THINKING

## UNIT 3: BRAINSTORMING TOOLS

1. Flip chart
  - Process:
    * Pen & paper & white board ready
    * Define briefly the problem
    * Organize so that all can see the white board
    * Invite solutions for a period of time (no criticism allowed)
    * Record ideas
    * End the session when frequency of new ideas and energy level drops
    * Review or reinvigorate for another session or inspire additional ideas
    
  > Flip charts are great for entry activity but they should only be used sparingly as they are one-sided approach with a single faciliator who records the idea
  
2. Post-it
  - Process:
    * Sticky notes & pen ready
    * Define briefly the problem
    * Allow participants to records all ideas of their own for 10-20 mins
    * Review the ideas generated individually or inspire additional ones
    * Review the idea collectively by asking the owner to pick up his/ her most favorite ones
    * Invite the group to categorize ideas by rearranging them, similar ones put into 1 group
    
3. Alphabet
  - Similar to Flip chart but follow the alphabetical sequential: each idea is represented by 1 key word, that key word must start with the letter we are currently in
  - I.e: 3 ideas to reduce plastic waste, starting with 3 first letters of your name:
    * D: Discipline - in our daily usage, say no to 1-time plastic container
    * T: Try - do the best to reuse plastic bags or sort out when disposing it
    * H: Honest - to yourself and the society that you can do it and inspire others to do it
