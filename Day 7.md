# CREATIVE THINKING

## UNIT 3: BRAINSTORMING TOOLS

1. Flip chart
  - Process:
    * Pen & paper & white board ready
    * Define briefly the problem
    * Organize so that all can see the white board
    * Invite solutions for a period of time (no criticism allowed)
    * Record ideas
    * End the session when frequency of new ideas and energy level drops
    * Review or reinvigorate for another session or inspire additional ideas
    
  > Flip charts are great for entry activity but they should only be used sparingly as they are one-sided approach with a single faciliator who records the idea
  
2. Post-it
  - Process:
    * Sticky notes & pen ready
    * Define briefly the problem
    * Allow participants to records all ideas of their own for 10-20 mins
    * Review the ideas generated individually or inspire additional ones
    * Review the idea collectively by asking the owner to pick up his/ her most favorite ones
    * Invite the group to categorize ideas by rearranging them, similar ones put into 1 group
    
3. Alphabet
  - Similar to Flip chart but follow the alphabetical sequential: each idea is represented by 1 key word, that key word must start with the letter we are currently in
  - I.e: 3 ideas to reduce plastic waste, starting with 3 first letters of your name:
    * D: Discipline - in our daily usage, say no to 1-time plastic container
    * T: Try - do the best to reuse plastic bags or sort out when disposing it
    * H: Honest - to yourself and the society that you can do it and inspire others to do it
    
4. Brainwriting
  - This is a combination of multiple previous technique
  - Arrange the group in a circle
  - Distribute blank cards to each participant
  - Ask participants to sketch an idea on a card
  - Allow participants to silently, pass the card to the next group member in one direction
  - Ask participants to read the card received and see if it inspires an idea (several idea cards will be being passed around the group)
  - Collect all cards after 10-20 min
  - Review the ideas generated collectively by asking participants to share their favourite ideas or by grading, i.e:
    Each participant in the session can be invited to evaluate the ideas with a traffic light system. In a traffic light system, each participant can be given a sheet of dots, say 5 dots, and can allocate them to ideas that they think warrant further consideration. The 5 dots can be distributed amongst different ideas, where more can be given to an idea you think is better than another. If you do not have dots or stickers, just draw on a dot! 
  
5. Grid
  - Provide group members with a grid 
  - Define and introduce the brief to the group
  - Ask participants to sketch and complete the top row
  - When finished, ask participants to place the sheets in the middle for someone else to work on the next row developing the ideas further
  - Once the grid is complete, review ideas as a group
  _For an effective grid brainstorming session, participants should be patient and allow each person to complete the row of ideas before passing on the page._
