## UNIT 6: TRIZ
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. What is TRIZ?
  - A technique to abstract the specific problem into general terms which have been successfully solved then, reapply those solutions back to our orginal one.
  - The emphasis in TRIZ is on finding inventive solutions and concepts from other fields that use available resources. In essence, it is a shortcut to experience.
2. TRIZ principles and tools
  - There are:
    - 39 parameters of TRIZ
    - 40 principles of TRIZ
  - In which, the most core point is: CONTRADICTION
  > The contradiction matrix indicates the most useful principles to be used to solve the contradiction between the parameter you are improving, and the parameter which worsens as a result of this improvement. 

3. Contraidction matrix
  - One of the main TRIZ tools
  - The matrix is organized in the form of 39 improving parameters and 39 worsening parameters, with each cell entry giving the most often used inventive principles that may be used to eliminate the contradiction.
  - Using contradiction matrix process:
    - Step 1: Identify critical features of the problem.
    - Step 2: Idnetify contradictions between features where one causes problems with another.
    - Step 3: Use the matrix to identify principles for resolutions.
    - Step 4: Use the numbers from the contradiction matrix to look up resolution principles and use these principles to find solutions to the problem.
  - Note:
    -The principles in the table for a given entry are listed in order of priority, based on analysis of previous solutions. The principal, most likely from experience to yield a helpful solution, is listed first.
